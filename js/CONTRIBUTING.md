## How to Contribute

Team contributions are how we keep our code great. Please adhere to the following guidelines.

### Workflow

- Always pull the latest from master before making any changes to it directly.
- Please submit a pull request for major updates that require testing.

If you've never submitted a pull request, follow the [contribution docs](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

1. Create a branch - name it something relevant
2. Add commits - as many as you need
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Deploy
5. Merge into master - delete branch if no longer needed
